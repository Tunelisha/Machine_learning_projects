# Image Classifier Model: Implementation using Python and Keras

A Neural network model was built using Keras . The Dataset used was the Fashion-Mnist consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
