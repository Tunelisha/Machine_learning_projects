# **Email Spam Filtering: An Implementation with Python and Scikit-learn**

Spam filtering is a document classification task which involves classifying an email as spam or non-spam (a.k.a. ham) mail. Spam box in your Gmail account is the best example of this.

The Dataset used in training the model can be found [here](https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/). The Enron-Spam in pre-processed form was used. It contains five folders of which each folder contains a spam and a ham folder. Each spam and ham folder contains email files. I extracted all these email files (33,722) into a single directory on googlecolab.
